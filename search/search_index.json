You can then use the <code>generate_response_sync</code> method to generate an AI response and the <code>stop</code> method to stop the session. You can use the generate response method multiple times in a single session to have a conversation with the AI.</p>"},{"location":"#contributing","title":"Contributing","text":"<p>Contributions are welcome.
